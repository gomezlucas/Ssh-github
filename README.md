# What is SSH ? 

SSh stands for Secure Socket Shell and It's a protocol that allow two devices to communicate in a secure way. 
It uses 3 techniques to achieve that:

* Symmetrical Encryption
* Asymmetrical Encryption
* Hashing

Symmetrical encryption uses one secret Key :key: for encryption and decryption by both parts. 
The problem is that anyone who has the key can access to the message or to the communication. 

To solve that, this protocol uses what they call Key Exchange algorithm. The key :key: is never transfered instead the 
two computers share public pieces of data (a public key) and then manipulate it (with a private key) to independently calculate the Secret key :key:. That secret key is
specific to each SSH session and is generated prior to authentication, that process actually uses Asymmetrical
encryption.

In order to verify the authenticity of the message, in other words to check that It hasnÂ´t been altered, the protocol uses another form of cryptography called Hashing.
